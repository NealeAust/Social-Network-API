## Project Summary

To build an API for a social network web application for users to share thoughts, add a reaction to a thought and make a friends list. The application will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.  The project also requires formatting a timestamp, which may involve installing a date package. 

To include a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the Social-Network-API in accordance with the requirements set out in the acceptance criteria. 

## Video

The following video shows how to invoke the Social Network API web application and provides a demonstration of its functionality using the Insomnia AAPI Design Platform.

## Social Network API

The Social Network API web application has been developed as an easy-to-use social network application that allows users to interact both with the computing environment and the work of other users.  This includes sharing thoughts and information, posting a reaction to other users thoughts and creating friends. It has been purposely designed to meet a number of non-functional requirements including functionality and inviting aesthetics when using the Insomnia AAPI Design Platform.

## Project Description
 
The main objective of this project was to build the API for a social network application from scratch. It involved writing code to enable users to view, add, update and delete data. As part of the project the Insomnia AAPI Design Platform was to be used as the user interface where the data was created and various functions for both users and thoughts could be performed.

The project also required loading a range of software packages and linking them.

## Usage

To access the web application the user firstly has to connect to the local server using the command **npm run start**. 

Upon successfully entering this command the sentence **"App listening on port 3001!"** is displayed.

At this point the user navigates to insomnia where the following side menu is displayed:

The user selects and clicks on the chosen option and depending on the function enters information such as, name & email details or thought text. The user may be required to type in or copy & paste one or more *id numbers*.
